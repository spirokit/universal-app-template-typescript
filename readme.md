3. Download the `spirokit-core-[version].tgz` file from Gumroad and add it to the root of your project.

4. Install SpiroKit on `/packages/app`

## üî¶ About

This monorepo is a blank(ish) starter for an Expo + Next.js app.

While it's pretty barebones, it does a lot of the annoying config for you.

## üóÇ Folder layout

- `apps` entry points for each app

  - `expo`
  - `next`

- `packages` shared packages across apps
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)
    - `navigation` Next.js has a `pages/` folder. React Native doesn't. This folder contains navigation-related code for RN. You may use it for any navigation code, such as custom links.

You can add other folders inside of `packages/` if you know what you're doing and have a good reason to.

## üèÅ Start the app

- Install dependencies: `yarn`

- Next.js local dev: `yarn web`
  - Runs `yarn next`
- Expo local dev: `yarn native`
  - Runs `expo start`

## üÜï Add new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

If you're installing a JavaScript-only dependency that will be used across platforms, install it in `packages/app`:

```sh
cd packages/app
yarn add date-fns
cd ../..
yarn
```

### Native dependencies

If you're installing a library with any native code, you must install it in `apps/expo`:

```sh
cd apps/expo
yarn add react-native-reanimated

cd ../..
yarn
```

You can also install the native library inside of `packages/app` if you want to get autoimport for that package inside of the `app` folder. However, you need to be careful and install the _exact_ same version in both packages. If the versions mismatch at all, you'll potentially get terrible bugs.
